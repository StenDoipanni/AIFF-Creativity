The spatio-temporal warp has transformed the environment, scattering dinosaurs across the landscape and rolling back time itself. Amid this prehistoric upheaval, the child, now friends with dinosaurs, stumbles upon mammals that move stealthily under the cover of night, hiding from the dominant reptiles. This alliance fills him with guilt, fearing that his actions might lead to the extinction of these mammals, his ancestors, potentially causing a catastrophic time-paradox. By day, he runs, seeking refuge in a cave, wrestling with the weight of his decisions. Determined, he sets out to find the crucial link, the first primordial ancestor that bridges mammals and humans, hoping to understand his place in this altered reality. This quest, set against a backdrop of friendship, guilt, and the search for belonging, is depicted in a movie dramatic, hyperrealistic style.
